### <a id="styling-header"></a>Styling

#### SetTheme function

There are two ways of styling mediastore-sdk components. First one is using setTheme() function which gives a possibility to change basic colors for whole mediastore-sdk components.

Here is an example how to do it:

```javascript
Config.setTheme({
  fontColor: "#ffffff",
  backgroundColor: "#292525",
  cardColor: "#675d5d",
  successColor: "#435dc5",
  primaryColor: "#435dc5",
  loaderColor: "#cccccc",
  errorColor: "red",
  logoUrl: "link-to-the-logo"
});
```

#### Custom styles

Another way of styling componets from library is creating custom styles and overriding default styles by those that you have created.
Every mediastore-sdk library component has many classes that can be used to select element that needs to be styled. Their names are based on BEM.

Here is a simple exapmle how styles can be added:

```css
.msd__header {
  background: #292525;
  border-bottom: none;
}
.msd__header div {
  background-image: url("./logo\ â€”\ white.png");
  background-size: auto 60%;
}
.msd__auth-wrapper {
  background: #292525;
}
.msd__input {
  color: #fff;
}
.msd__input__label {
  background: #292525;
  color: #fff;
}
```
