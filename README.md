### Configuration

You should start configuration by setting publisher settings such as: `publisherId`, `offerId` or environment (if it's needed).
You can do this by using Config class which has few important methods to do it.

1. Setting `publisherId`:

```javascript
Config.setPublisher("publisherId");
```

where `publisherId` is your publisher ID in the Cleeng system.

2. Setting `offerId`

```javascript
Config.setOffer("offerId");
```

where `offerId` is the ID of the offer created for your publisher in the Cleeng system.

3. Setting environment:

```javascript
Config.setEnvironment("environment");
```

where environment is one of the environments listed below:

- `staging`
- `sandbox`

You can also style the application by using one of the Config.setTheme() method but there will be more information about that in the [Styling](#styling-header) section.

There are two ways of styling MediaStore SDK components:

- [SetTheme function](#set-theme-header)
- [Custom styles](#custom-styles-header)

#### <a id="set-theme-header"></a>SetTheme function

The setTheme() function gives a possibility to change basic colors for all MediaStore SDK components.

Here is an example how to do it:

```javascript
Config.setTheme({
  fontColor: "#ffffff",
  backgroundColor: "#292525",
  cardColor: "#675d5d",
  successColor: "#435dc5",
  primaryColor: "#435dc5",
  loaderColor: "#cccccc",
  errorColor: "red",
  logoUrl: "link-to-the-logo"
});
```

#### <a id="custom-styles-header"></a>Custom styles

Another way of styling components from the library is creating custom styles and overriding default styles by those that you have created.
Every MediaStore SDK library component has many classes that can be used to select an element that needs to be styled. Their names are based on BEM.

Here is a simple example how styles can be added:

```css
.msd__header {
  background: #292525;
  border-bottom: none;
}
.msd__header div {
  background-image: url("./logo\ â€”\ white.png");
  background-size: auto 60%;
}
.msd__auth-wrapper {
  background: #292525;
}
.msd__input {
  color: #fff;
}
.msd__input__label {
  background: #292525;
  color: #fff;
}
```
